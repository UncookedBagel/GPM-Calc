Hey All!

Welcome! Here I have made a simple GPM calculator as an exercise in GUI and C#.
I've only just started my jouney with C# - 3 1/2 days and counting as of this publish.

The calculater will accept input to 2 of 3 boxes at once.
It will fill in the blank box with the appropriate andwer.

Use is pretty stright forward.

Feel free to check it out. 

Still figuring out how to post the source for y'all to see!
